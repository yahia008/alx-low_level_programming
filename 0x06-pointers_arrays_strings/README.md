C - More pointers, arrays and strings Project
I continued to practice utilizing pointers, arrays, and strings in C in this project.

Tasks
<0. strcat - C function that concatenates two strings.

1. strncat - C function that concatenates two strings using at most an inputted number of bytes.

2. strncpy - C function that copies a string, including the terminating null byte, using at most an inputted number of bytes.

3. strcmp - C function that compares two strings

4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy - C function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

5. Always look up - C function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes - C function that capitalizes all words of a string.

7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody - C function that encodes a string into 1337, without switch or ternary operations and using only one if and two loops.

8. rot13 - C function that encodes a string to rot13, without switch or ternary operations and using only one if and two loops.

9. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper - C function that prints an integer without using long, arrays, pointers, or hard-coded special values.

10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work - C program that prints a[2] = 98 using pointer magic.

11. It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art - C function that adds two numbers stored in strings to a buffer. Assumes that strings are never empty and that numbers will always be positive, or 0.

12. Noise is a buffer, more effective than cubicles or booth walls - C function that prints the content of an inputted number of bytes from a buffer.
